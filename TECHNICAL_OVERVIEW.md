## 1. What Is Vulcan?

Vulcan is an internal project management and task collaboration platform. It allows teams to organize work into projects, assign tasks to one or more team members, track progress across statuses, and communicate through comments — all from a single web interface.

Key capabilities:
- Create and manage projects with active/archived lifecycle
- Create tasks with priority, due date, and status tracking
- Assign tasks to **multiple users** (many-to-many)
- View work on a **Kanban board** with drag-and-drop
- Filter and sort tasks by project, status, priority, or assignee
- Leave and manage **comments** on tasks
- **Admin panel** for user creation and management
- **Profile editing** (name, email, password)

## 3. System Architecture

```
Browser (localhost:5173)
        │
        │  HTTP/JSON  (Authorization: Bearer <token>)
        ▼
┌──────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐
│  React Frontend  │◄──────►│  Laravel Backend │◄──────►│   PostgreSQL DB  │
│  (Vite / Node)   │        │  (PHP artisan)   │        │  (port 5432)     │

└──────────────────┘        └──────────────────┘        └──────────────────┘

All three services run in isolated Docker containers on a shared internal network.
```

```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Many-to-many task assignment** — tasks are linked to users through a `task_user` pivot table, allowing a single task to be assigned to multiple team members simultaneously
- **Cascade deletes** — deleting a project cascades to its tasks and their comments
- **Active task guard** — projects cannot be deleted while they have tasks in `todo` or `in_progress` status (returns HTTP 422)
- **Archived project guard** — new tasks cannot be marked complete in an archived project

## 7. Authentication & Security

**Mechanism:** Laravel Sanctum token authentication (stateless API)

**Login flow:**
1. User submits credentials to `POST /api/login`
2. Backend validates against bcrypt-hashed password
3. Returns a personal access token (stored in `personal_access_tokens` table)
4. Frontend stores token in `localStorage`, sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all API requests

**Authorization levels:**
- **Unauthenticated** — login only
- **Authenticated user** — manage own projects and tasks, view assigned tasks
- **Admin** — full access to all projects, all tasks, user management

**Security measures:**
- Login endpoint rate-limited to 5 requests/minute
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt via Laravel's `Hash::make()`
- Profile password changes require current password verification
- Users cannot delete their own admin account
- CORS restricted to `http://localhost:5173`

## 8. Key Features in Detail

### Kanban Board
The Kanban board provides a visual three-column layout (To Do / In Progress / Done). Tasks can be dragged between columns using the browser's native HTML5 Drag and Drop API — no third-party dependencies. Dropping a card calls `PUT /api/tasks/:id` to persist the status change, with optimistic UI updates that revert on error.

### Multi-User Task Assignment
Tasks support assignment to multiple users through a many-to-many relationship. The frontend provides a custom multi-select dropdown showing all team members. Assigned users are displayed as stacked avatar initials with overflow indicators (e.g. `+2`). On save, the backend syncs the `task_user` pivot table using Laravel's `sync()` method.

### Dashboard
The dashboard displays four live statistics cards:
- Active projects count
- Pending tasks (status: todo)
- Overdue tasks (past due date, not done)
- Tasks assigned to the current user

Below the stats, a filterable list of recent tasks is shown.

### Admin Panel
Admins have access to a dedicated user management page where they can create new accounts (with role selection) and delete existing users. Admins also see all projects system-wide rather than only their own.
